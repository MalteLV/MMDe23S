        Rasputina is an American rock band based in New York City, known for an
        unconventional music style, as well as a fascination with historical
        allegories and fashion, especially those pertaining to the Victorian
        era. The group is fronted by cellist/vocalist Melora Creager, who writes
        the music and lyrics and creates art for the band's albums, singles, and
        website.

          In 1989, Creager wrote a manifesto, and placed an ad in The Village
          Voice seeking women to form an electric cello choir. Julia Kent, then
          an editor at the Village Voice, was the first respondent. The original
          group of nine was whittled to three. They named themselves
          "Rasputina", after one of Creager's songs. The group performed
          frequently and became a local favorite in New York City. Columbia
          Records' A&R representative and producer Jimmy Boyle saw the group
          perform at a New York festival. He signed the group to the Columbia
          Records label in 1996. Creager and Boyle produced their first album on
          Columbia titled Thanks for the Ether. In 1997 the band released
          Transylvanian Regurgitations, a follow-up EP remixed by Marilyn Manson
          and Twiggy Ramirez.

          On their second full-length album, How We Quit the Forest, Rasputina
          signed on Chris Vrenna (from Nine Inch Nails) as their drummer and
          producer. He also provided electronic drums and sound effects.
          Rasputina toured with such musicians as Bob Mould, Porno for Pyros,
          Marilyn Manson, Siouxsie Sioux, and Les Claypool. Creager played cello
          with Nirvana for their final tour in Europe, 1994. The band appeared
          as musical guests on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on two occasions,
          once in 1996 and again in 1998, to promote Thanks for the Ether and
          How We Quit the Forest respectively.

          After working first with Columbia and then Instinct Records to produce
          their first four albums and first four EPs, the band then went on to
          produce all their subsequent work through Melora Creager's own record
          label, Filthy Bonnet Recording Co., starting with their live album A
          Radical Recital in 2005, and later often selling music at their live
          shows or through the band's website directly, with no label
          affiliation, beginning with The Willow Tree Triptych in 2009. These
          off-label releases have generally been very limited runs, often with
          only around 100 copies being made available. In summer 2010, a
          documentary was made about Rasputina called Under the Corset by Dawn
          Miceli. In January 2011 Melora Creager announced on The Dawn and Drew
          Show that Dawn Miceli would be playing the drums on the February 2011
          tour. Rasputina released Unknown on April 10, 2015. The record is a
          concept album that exhibits the band's frontwoman, Melora Creager's,
          trauma after her computer was hacked into. The album is only available
          on CD from the band's website so, as Melora states on the site
          "conceptually... anyone who purchases it is known to me." The entire
          album was recorded solo by Creager in three weeks. The 2015 "Unknown"
          lineup is the first in the history of Rasputina to add piano and beat
          boxing, in place of traditional drums, by Luis Mojica.
        </p>
        <p>
          On June 26, 2015 Rasputina released a compilation of demo recordings
          from 1991 to 1997 titled "Magnetic Strip" and was only available by
          digital download on the band's website. In the fall of 2016, Polly
          Panic joined Rasputina as the second cellist. The first tour of the
          line up with Melora, Polly Panic as second cellist/backing vocalist,
          and Luis Mojica as keyboardist/beat boxer and backing vocalist. In
          July 2017, Melora Creager announced a new album, The Feel-Good Hits of
          1817. In her email newsletter, she stated that the album would be
          vinyl-only, and limited in quantity. The album None but the Lonely
          Heart was released through the band's website in 2018. The album is a
          collection of piano covers performed by Creager, including songs by
          Patti Smith, Duke Ellington, The Smiths, and Carl Sandburg. The title
          is taken from the Tchaikovsky song of the same name, which also serves
          as the first track on the album. In 2019, the album Skin is Living
          Leather was released on the band's website. It features nine songs,
          three of which are covers, five new songs written by Creager, and one
          which was co-written with Creager's daughter Ivy.

        Creager is a self-proclaimed history buff and often bases the lyrics for
        the band on that historical knowledge. These include:

      <p>
        Thanks for the Ether "My Little Shirtwaist Fire" is based on the
        Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911. "The Donner Party" discusses
        the Donner Party, a group of American pioneers traveling to California
        who encountered a series of mishaps and resorted to cannibalism. The
        track compares them to the colonial pilgrims. "Howard Hughes" is about
        the eccentric billionaire aviator.
      </p>
      <p>
        How We Quit the Forest "Rose K." is about the matriarch of the Kennedy
        family, who had a stroke at age 94 and was cared for at the Kennedy
        Compound by private nurses and staff. Although Melora jokingly refers to
        this as her "Alzheimer's Song" on A Radical Recital, Rose was not known
        to have suffered from Alzheimer's disease. In concert, Melora also
        frequently introduces the song by referring to Rose's husband's decision
        to have her daughter Rosemary Kennedy lobotomized at the age of 23, to
        calm her alleged mood swings. "Herb Girls of Birkenau" describes the
        victims of human experiments in the Nazi concentration camp
        Auschwitz-Birkenau, from the point of view of a powerless witness.
        "Diamond Mind" is a satire inspired by the music of a De Beers diamond
        commercial that uses music composed by Karl Jenkins, which he later used
        as a theme of the orchestral piece Palladio.

        Cabin Fever "Rats" is about the 16th century decision by the then Pope
        to declare the semi-aquatic capybara as fish for Catholics to eat during
        Lent.

        Poor Relations in the Shed Out Back (Frustration Plantation bonus disc)
        "Yellow Fever" is about an outbreak of yellow fever in New Orleans in
        the summer of 1853.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perilous World "1816, The Year Without a Summer" is about the Little Ice
        Age. The year 1816 had an unusual weather pattern (due to the volcano
        Mount Tambora erupting) and was known as the Year Without a Summer. The
        song also makes mention of author Mary Shelley writing her famous novel
        Frankenstein, Freemasons and Benjamin Franklin. "Choose Me For Champion"
        is based on a speech by Thursday October Christian I, and according to
        Creager also partially a translation of a speech made by Osama bin
        Laden. "Cage in a Cave" is about Thursday Christian's father, Fletcher
        Christian, an 18th-century man who was the leader of the mutineers from
        the Mutiny on the Bounty in Tahiti. "Incident in a Medical Clinic" is
        about the disease Schistosomiasis (also known as Snail-fever). "Child
        Soldier Rebellion" makes mention of the Lord's Resistance Army in
        Uganda's usage of children as soldiers. "Oh Bring Back the Egg Unbroken"
        is about the Tangata manu competition of the inhabitants from Easter
        Island. "In Old Yellowcake" utilizes imagery of the destruction of
        Fallujah.

        Sister Kinderhook "Sweet Sister Temperance" is about Emily Dickinson "A
        Holocaust of Giants" is about the Mound Builder giants of Illinois and
        Ohio. "The 2 Miss Leavens" refers to the painting "Harriet Leavens" by
        Ammi Phillips, as well as the 2008 death of Kylie Leavens. "Calico
        Indians" is about the Anti-Rent Wars of 1844, specifically inspired by
        the writings of Clara Barrus.
