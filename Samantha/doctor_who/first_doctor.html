        <h2>Character Description:</h2>
        <p>
        The First Doctor is the protagonist of the series "Doctor Who" and the first incarnation of the Time Lord. 
        He is an older, wise man with a distinctive character. In his first incarnation, he is often stern and 
        authoritarian but also kind-hearted and curious. The Doctor travels in a time machine called the TARDIS, 
        which looks like a British police call box on the outside. Despite his elderly appearance, he is full of 
        energy and a thirst for adventure.
