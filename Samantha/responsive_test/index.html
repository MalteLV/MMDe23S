            <p class="card__text">
                Halloween has its origins in a Celtic festival called Samhain, 
                which marked the beginning of winter. 
                The Celts believed that on this day, 
                the boundary between the world of the living 
                and the world of the dead blurred, and the spirits of the deceased 
                returned to Earth. With Christianization, the original 
                Samhain was transformed into the Christian holiday "All Hallows' Eve," 
                dedicated to the memory of saints</p>
