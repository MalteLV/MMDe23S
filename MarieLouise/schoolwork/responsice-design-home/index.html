    <h2>What’s girl math?</h2>
    <p>It’s something that only makes sense if you’re a woman. For example: “calories don’t count when you’re on your period”, or “not paying the $15 for shipping instead spending another $30 to get the free shipping“, or “packing a minimum of 14 pairs of underwear for a 7 day trip”. If you’re a man, it’s important to understand girl math so you can understand women a little better. If you’re a woman, this post will be very relatable. Scroll down to see the funniest examples!</p>

    <h2>What is girl dinner?</h2>
    <p>
      The informal term girl dinner is used to refer to a meal typically consisting of snacks, side dishes, and small portions of (often randomly assembled) foods.
      
      Regardless of its components, girl dinner is typically characterized by its small portions.
      
      The term girl dinner is usually applied to meals resembling what would commonly be considered to be a snack tray, snack platter, or small charcuterie board. Some examples of foods that may be included in a meal called a girl dinner include pieces of bread, cheese slices, sliced cold meats, fruits, vegetables, chips, and popcorn. Often, the term is used in reference to a meal made using whatever a person has available, including leftovers.

    <h2>Are men idiots who do stupid things? Study says yes</h2>
    <p>A new study shows what at least some of us might have suspected for a long time: Men are idiots and do stupid things.

      That's the premise of the authors' Male Idiot Theory. The study, published in BMJ, the former British Medical Journal, looked at past winners of the Darwin Awards. The awards are given to those people who die in such an idiotic manner that "their action ensures the long-term survival of the species, by selectively allowing one less idiot to survive."
      
      The study looked at 318 cases, of which 282, or 88.7 percent, were men.</p>
